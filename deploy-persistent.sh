# MCP Fetch Persistent Configuration

This MCP server is configured with consistent naming for container reuse.

## How it works:
1. All Claude instances use the same container name: `mcp-fetch`
2. Docker's `--rm` flag is removed from the configuration
3. Container is reused between Claude sessions when possible

## Configuration in mcp_servers.json:
The fetch server should NOT use `--rm` flag to allow reuse.

## Benefits:
- Consistent container naming across instances
- Faster startup (container already exists)
- Shared state between Claude instances
- Predictable container management

## Manual container management:
```bash
# Stop the container
docker stop mcp-fetch

# Remove the container
docker rm mcp-fetch

# Container will be recreated on next use
```
